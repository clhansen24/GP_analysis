'''
Use: Given a, find a's nearest neighbor in P
params: a - coordinate for which the nearest neighbor is to be found
P - set of points to look through
returns: p - index of a's nearest neighbor in P
d - distance between a and its nearest neigbor in P

'''
Use: To swap elements in index a and b in a given list P
params: a,b - index of the elements that need to be swapped
P - list containing the elements that need to be swapped
returns: the list P with elements in index a,b swapped

'''

'''
Use: To order a list of points on the principal curve from start to end of the curve 
params: x,y,z - coordinates of points on the principal curve 
returns: three arrays with x,y,z coordinates in the order determined

Approach:
Given a list of points,
- For the point in index 0, call it a, find its nearest neighbor from the remaining points in the list, call it b.
- Swap a's immediate neighbor, element in index 1, with the element in position b.
- From the list of points excluding a and b, find the nearest neighbor for a, call it c, and b, call it d.
- Once c and d are found, the following two cases are checked,
  Case 1: If c == d, i.e. if both a and b have the same neighbor, check if the new nearest neighbor found is closer to a or b.
    If it is closer to b, swap b's immediate neighbor with the element in position d. If it is closer to a, add the element
    in position c to the left of a, i.e to the beginning of the list. 
  Case 2: If c != d, swap b's immediate neighbor with the element in position d and add the element
    in position c to the left of a, i.e to the beginning of the list.
- In this way keep finding the nearest neighbors of the most recently swapped/added elements, and grow the array in both directions.
- Note that this method works if the first element in the original list is in the middle of the curve or one end of the curve.

Use: Defines x,y,z axes for every point on the principal curve based on the angle of rotation between two consecutive points 
params: CurvePts - ordered points on the principal curve 
returns: three lists of vectors defining the axes for every point on the principal curve 

Approach:
For a given list of points from start to end of the principal curve,
- Find the vector between the first two points on the curve. This is the z axis for the first point. 
- Then, define the x and y axes at the first point by finding two more vectors such that the x,y,z axes are othogonal to each other.
- Next, find the vector between the second and third points on the curve. This is the z axis for the second point. 
- Find the matrix of rotation between the z axis at the first point and the second point.
- Mutiply the x and y axes of the first point by the matrix of rotation. The rotated axes are the x and y axes at the second point. 
- Repeat this for every set of consecutive points on the curve.
